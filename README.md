# AddCycle

- 👋 Hi, I’m @AddCycle, a 3rd year student at Ingineering IT school EPITA
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Videogames and making/contributing to opensource projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some game projects because it's more fun but I'd like to learn by contributing on every subject
- 📫 How to reach me : addcycledz@gmail.com || my discord account discordapp.com/users/adel053315 
- 😄 Pronouns: Straight (like any other Ingineer Student)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Young -> me -> website coding -> for fun >> crazy
